# Battlehack2020
Battlecode Min-season, Battlehack2020

As per their [instructions](http://bh2020.battlecode.org/getting-started), I cloned the `Battlehack 2020 scaffold` and pip installed `battlehack20`.  For my own development purposes, I chose to create a separate folder/repo to work in rather than forking and developing inside the scaffold, and my bot folder(s) are symlinked into the scaffold folder.
